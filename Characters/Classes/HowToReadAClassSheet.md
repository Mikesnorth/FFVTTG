# Stats
This section covers stat augmentations for the given class. Values (or formulas) here are applied to your base stats.
If your base `Physical Strength` is 5, and the class is `Physical Strength + 2`, while plaing as the given class, your `Physical Strength` stat is 7.

# Action
This is the action that you always have access to whenever playing as the given class.

# Learned Abilities
This section outlines the abilities you can learn as you gain AP with the given class. The number in parens `()` after the ability name is the class AP required to 'learn' that ability. Once an ability is learned, it can by used by other classes. If your `Black Mage` has 10 AP, it has access to the ability `Black 2`. This means that even when you are currently plaing as a `Knight`, you may select `Black 2` as your secondary ability, and can cast black magic spells up to level 2.
AP does not reset when you gain a class level. It is a running total. The level 6 `black MAge` ability `Black 6` requires 135 AP to learn. The level 7 Black Mage abiltiy `MP+30%` requires 250 AP to learn. So moving from level 6 to 7 requires 115 AP (135 to 250), not an additional 250 from where you were.
